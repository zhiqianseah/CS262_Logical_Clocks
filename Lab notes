Set up client and server connections in the VM. It works!

Problem: How to get the third machine in?

Got the VM to run in ticks. The way is to pause for the time difference between VM_time_interval and elapsed_time

Next, moved the receiving_msg part to a separate thread, so that the VM can run independently of the receiving of messages
