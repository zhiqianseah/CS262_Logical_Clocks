# CS 262 Logical Clocks

## Mac
Run the `mac_start.sh` file which will automatically start the 3 VMs in separate terminal windows.

## Other
Run VM1.py followed by VM2.py, followed by VM3.py on different command windows.
The VMs will only run when all 3 have established connection. There is a short delay before the machines will start trying to connect to each other.

## Log files
The 3 log files will be created as `VM1.log`, `VM2.log`, and `VM3.log`.

## Running time
By default, the VMs will run with the default configuration for 60 seconds and then shutdown.
